# Warfront Nations
This is an old and early project of mine, so the code is not mean to be sane or maintainable. Warfront Nations was made in 2019. 

I would not recommend using this project for learning purposes or anything else similar (The code is quite bad and most things are hard-coded in).

**Description pulled from site:**
